//PRIMITIVE DATA

//We need a way to reuse of access data, so we create a REFERENCE
//'const' alerts JS to reserve some space in memory
//With 'const' I cannot reassign the value in memory; If unsure use 'const'
//We provide a name for this space in memory
//We use the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR '='
//This takes the VALUE on the right and assigns to the NAMED REFERENCE.
const myString = "string";

//Use 'let' ONLY if we plan to REASSIGN the VALUE REFERENCED by the VARIABLE.
let myNum = 23;

//myString = "something else";

console.log(myNum);
